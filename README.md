## Road map
Currently the code only checks if the winning condition is met. 

### Future implementations:
  * Ask the user for the input to build the matrix.
  * Create a computer player which places characters on the matrix randomly.
  * Create a two player mode on the game.
  * Add intelligence to the computer player.
  * Add a GUI to the proyect.
